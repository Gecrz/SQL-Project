### Data Modeling

Create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) by inspecting the provided CSV files.

**Note:** For the `credit_card` table, the `card` column will be a VARCHAR(20) datatype rather than an INT.

Part of the challenge here is to figure out how many tables you should create, as well as what kind of relationships you need to define among the tables.

### Data Engineering

Using your database model as a blueprint, we will create a database schema for each of your tables and relationships. Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any other constraints you defined.

After creating the database schema, we imported the data from the corresponding CSV files.
